\section{Conclusion} \label{ICRA:sec:conclusion}

This chapter studies the problem of adapting learned dynamics models to datasets which contains transitions where the dynamics are very different from the source environment. This type of domain mismatch is common in online dynamics learning settings, where the source dynamics are learned in simulation or on a simpler task. Traditional adaptation methods can fail in this setting because trying to fit data from regions of dissimilar dynamics leads to poor predictions even in regions where the source and target dynamics are similar.

Our key insight is to instead focus adaptation on regions where the source and target dynamics are similar. We propose an adaptation method which assigns high weight to transitions with low prediction error, and dynamically re-assigns weights during the course of training. The set of low-error transitions is initially a small set, but grows as training pulls down the prediction error for other similar transitions. We combine our adaptation method with prior work on planning with unreliable dynamics to make \FOCUS{}, a data-efficient online adaptation method. We demonstrate that \FOCUS{} can learn a bimanual rope manipulation task in simulation and in the real world, and achieves higher task success rates than baselines which attempt to fit all the training data.
