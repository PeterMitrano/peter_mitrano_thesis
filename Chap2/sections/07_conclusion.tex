\section{Conclusion}

In summary, the proposed method is able to complete a variety of difficult rope manipulation tasks in clutter. We are able to learn the unconstrained dynamics accurately, and by using our learned classifier, the planner successfully avoids the regions of state-action space where these unconstrained dynamics are incorrect. Using the classifier outperforms both using the full dynamics and simply trusting the unconstrained model by a wide margin. Last, recovery makes the method more resilient, allowing the robot to act even when it cannot trust its dynamics model. In our tabletop manipulation simulations, we demonstrated that these recovery actions statistically significantly improve the success rate of our method.
