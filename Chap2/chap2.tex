This first chapter addresses the questions ``When should we trust a dynamics model?'' and  ``What do we do if the model is unreliable at the current state?''. I introduce a formal problem statement for planning with unreliable dynamics, and formalize learning reliability as a binary classification problem. I then propose methods for learning this classifier and using this classifier in planning. I also define what it means to be in need of recovery in terms of the classifier. Using this definition, I then propose a method for learning a recovery policy for these states using the data already collected for the classifier.
