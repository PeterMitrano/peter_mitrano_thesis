\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed the \signature{} which describes the topology of closed loops formed by grasping the DOO with respect to closed loops formed by stationary objects in the environment. Our \signature{} builds on the h-signature proposed in prior work on topological path planning. Furthermore, we describe an algorithm for manipulating DOOs that plans grasps based on the proposed \signature{}. In our experiments, we find that using the \signature{} improves task success and reduces planning times compared to a task and motion-planning method. Finally, we use the method to thread a cable and bring it to a goal region on a real robot.
